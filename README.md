# Precourse Assessment

This will assess your learning of Javascript, HTML, and CSS from the precourse. There are no tests. It is up to you to determine if your answers are correct.

### Part 1 - Javascript

Complete the challenges in the `main.js`. To test your answers, you might want to test them out in the Chrome console or in the terminal with NodeJS.


### Part 2 - HTML/CSS

In the time available, create the closest possible clone of [this website](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/). Do not use the Chrome DevTools to inspect the DOM. What will you use to achieve the two-column layout? Tables? Divs? Do this in `index.html` and `style.css`.

**BONUS:** Add a perpetually rotating picture of an animal to your page WITHOUT using CSS3 animations, i.e. via JavaScript.
